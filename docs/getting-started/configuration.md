# Configuration

Auto AI Router is configured via a YAML file passed with the `-config` flag.

See the full example in [`config.yaml.example`](https://github.com/MiXaiLL76/auto_ai_router/blob/main/config.yaml.example).

| `model_prices_sync_interval` | duration | 5m          | How often model prices are re-fetched from `model_prices_link`                                        |
| `proxy_health_timeout`       | duration | 15s         | Timeout for fetching `/health` from remote proxy credentials                                          |
| `response_headers.mode`      | string   | passthrough | Response header policy. Supported values are `passthrough` and `allowlist`                            |
| `tiktoken_enabled`           | bool     | true        | Local tiktoken-based fallback token estimation for streaming responses (see below)                    |

The `allowlist` mode forwards `Content-Type`, `Cache-Control`, `Retry-After`, `Content-Disposition`, `Content-Range`, `Last-Modified`, and `Location`. Transport headers are generated by the router. Other upstream response headers are removed.

When `credential_name_as_team_id` is enabled, spend logs use the selected provider credential name as `team_id` only when the authenticated key does not provide a `team_id`. An explicit team assignment always takes precedence. This is intended for billing-aggregator AIR instances that group spend by provider credential; leave it disabled for embedded routers and migration helpers.

`model_prices_sync_interval` controls how often the price source is re-read after the initial startup load. It accepts any Go duration string (`30s`, `15m`, `1h`) and is ignored when `model_prices_link` is empty. A failed refresh keeps the previously loaded prices and is retried on the next tick; a missing or non-positive value falls back to `5m`. See [Model Pricing](../litellm-integration/pricing.md#refresh-interval) for guidance on picking a value.

When PostgreSQL or Kafka spend logging is enabled, every routed model must have a price entry. If neither its real provider name nor its alias can be priced, the router returns `503 Model pricing unavailable` before contacting the provider. Use an explicit zero-price entry for intentionally free models.

`tiktoken_enabled` controls the local prompt/completion token estimator used as a fallback for streaming responses when a provider doesn't report usage (e.g. the stream is cut before the final usage chunk, or the provider omits token counts entirely), and for budget-reservation cost estimates ahead of the request. Two different costs apply while it's on: the **prompt-token estimate and the final completion-token BPE count are lazy** — computed only if a stream actually finishes without provider-reported usage — so they're free for providers that do report usage. However, **per-chunk delta-text accumulation runs on every streaming chunk of every stream** while this flag is on, regardless of whether the provider ultimately reports usage, since the accumulator has to keep pace with the stream in case it's needed at the end.

Set to `false` to skip local estimation entirely if all your configured providers always report usage and you'd rather not carry any tiktoken-related per-chunk cost. This has three effects, not just spend logging: spend logs show `0` prompt/completion tokens (instead of an estimate) for streaming requests where a provider omits usage; the streaming-fallback total that feeds `rateLimiter.ConsumeTokens`/`ConsumeModelTokens` is zeroed the same way; and budget-reservation cost estimates (`server.litellm_db.enforce_budget_reservation`) undercount, reflecting only the completion-token portion — reservation itself still runs, it just can't account for prompt-token cost without local tokenization.

## Fail2Ban Parameters

The `fail2ban` block bans a `credential + model` pair after repeated failures at configured HTTP status codes, so a broken or rate-limited upstream stops eating a share of round-robin traffic. See [Fail2Ban](../advanced/f2b.md) for the full parameter reference, per-error-code rules, and per-credential overrides (for upstreams — e.g. resellers/aggregators — that signal failure with a different status code than the rest of the pool).

## Credentials

Each credential defines a connection to an LLM provider. See [Providers](../providers/index.md) for details on each type.

Common fields for all credentials:

| Field              | Type   | Description                                                                                                                      |

### Outbound proxy per credential

Set one `proxy_url` on a credential to route its upstream requests through a fixed proxy:

```yaml
credentials:
  - name: openai_main
    type: openai
    api_key: os.environ/OPENAI_API_KEY
    base_url: https://api.openai.com
    proxy_url: os.environ/OPENAI_PROXY_URL
```

For example, set `OPENAI_PROXY_URL=http://user:password@proxy.example.com:3128`.
Supported schemes: `http`, `https`, `socks5`, and `socks5h`. Percent-encode special
characters in usernames and passwords. Both SOCKS5 schemes resolve destination
hostnames through the proxy.

The setting applies to ordinary and streaming provider requests, Vertex AI OAuth
token acquisition and refresh, and `/health` and `/v1/models` discovery for `air`
and `proxy` credentials. An explicit URL overrides `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`,
and `NO_PROXY`. When omitted or empty, the existing environment-based behavior
is preserved. Invalid URLs are rejected during config loading without exposing
proxy credentials in the error. If the proxy fails, the request fails through
the usual credential retry/fallback flow; it does not retry the same credential
directly. Proxy lists and rotation are not supported.

### Fixed upstream request headers

By default the router forwards the client's own headers (except authentication,
hop-by-hop, client-IP and internal AIR headers) to the provider, including its
`User-Agent`. Set `request_headers` on a credential to send fixed values instead,
for example when the provider's WAF rejects some client User-Agents (Novita's
Cloudflare answers `Python-urllib/*` with `403 error code: 1010`):

```yaml
credentials:
  - name: novita
    type: openai
    api_key: os.environ/NOVITA_API_KEY
    base_url: https://api.novita.ai/openai
    request_headers:
      User-Agent: "auto-ai-router/1.0"      # replaces the client's User-Agent
      X-Provider-Token: os.environ/NOVITA_TOKEN
      X-Client-Hint: ""                     # empty: never send this header
```

- The configured value replaces every value the client sent under the same name
  (names are case-insensitive). An empty or blank value removes the header; for
  `User-Agent` this sends none at all rather than Go's default `Go-http-client`.
- Applies to every request sent with the credential: regular and streaming HTTP
  requests, retries (a retry on another credential uses that credential's
  headers) and the native WebSocket handshake of `/v1/responses`.
- Values support `os.environ/VAR`. A variable that is unset or blank is a
  config error, not a silent removal. Surrounding spaces and tabs are trimmed.
- Values are never logged: startup logs list header names only, and the debug
  dump of outbound headers shows `[credential request_headers]` instead.
- Only for direct providers. `air` and `proxy` credentials reject the field: the
  remote router would treat the headers as client headers and forward them to
  every provider behind it. Set them on the provider credential of the router
  that actually calls the provider.
- Headers the router manages itself are rejected at load time: `Authorization`,
  `X-Api-Key`, `X-Goog-Api-Key`, `Host`, `Content-*`, `Transfer-Encoding`,
  `Expect`, `Accept-Encoding`, `Anthropic-Beta`, `Anthropic-Version`, `Origin`,
  hop-by-hop headers (`Connection`, `Keep-Alive`, `Proxy-Connection`,
  `Proxy-Authenticate`, `Proxy-Authorization`, `TE`, `Trailer`, `Upgrade`),
  and the `Air-*` and `Sec-WebSocket-*` families. Invalid header names and values
  with control characters (CR, LF, NUL, ...) are rejected too.

### Scoped credential visibility

Credential scopes let one shared AIR instance expose different providers to different API keys.
If `scopes` is omitted or empty, the credential remains available to everyone. If `scopes`
is set, a request can use the credential only when the request API key has at least one
matching scope. `denied_scopes` always wins over `scopes`.

```yaml
credentials:
  - name: shared-openai
    type: openai
    api_key: "os.environ/OPENAI_KEY"
    base_url: "https://api.openai.com/v1"
    rpm: -1

  - name: team-a-openai
    type: openai
    api_key: "os.environ/TEAM_A_OPENAI_KEY"
    base_url: "https://api.openai.com/v1"
    rpm: -1
    scopes: [team-a]

  - name: all-except-team-a
    type: openai
    api_key: "os.environ/SHARED_KEY"
    base_url: "https://api.openai.com/v1"
    rpm: -1
    denied_scopes: [team-a]
```

For LiteLLM DB auth, request scopes are read from API key metadata:

```json
{
  "air_scopes": ["team-a"],
  "air_denied_scopes": ["premium"]
}
```

If `air_scopes` is not set, AIR falls back to the LiteLLM API key name
(`key_name`, then `key_alias`). For example, a key named `team-a` gets the `team-a`
scope automatically. The master key bypasses scope filters.

For DB-loaded credentials, add the same fields to `LiteLLM_CredentialsTable.credential_info`:

```json
{
  "custom_llm_provider": "openai",
  "air_scopes": ["team-a"],
  "air_denied_scopes": ["premium"]
}
```

Scope filtering applies to routing, retry/fallback selection, `/health`, `/v1/models`,
`/trace`, `/vhealth`, and `/vtrace`.

In both LiteLLM API-key metadata and `LiteLLM_CredentialsTable.credential_info`,
`air_forbidden_scopes` is accepted as an alias for `air_denied_scopes`.

Set `reasoning_only: true` on a credential when its provider accepts only reasoning traffic:

```yaml
credentials:
  - name: anthropic-reasoning
    type: anthropic
    api_key: "os.environ/ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
    base_url: "https://api.anthropic.com"
    reasoning_only: true
```

The filter recognizes enabled `reasoning_effort`, `reasoning`, `thinking`,
`thinking_budget`, and `thinking_level` parameters. Requests that omit reasoning or
explicitly disable it skip the credential during initial selection, sticky routing,
retries, and fallback selection. For DB-loaded credentials, use
`"air_reasoning_only": true` in `credential_info`.

## Models

The `models` section binds specific models to credentials and optionally sets per-model rate limits.

```yaml
models:
  - name: "gpt-4o"
    credential: openai_main
    rpm: 100
    tpm: 50000
```

By default, all models are available through all credentials. Use the `models` section to restrict which credentials serve which models.

By default, models can also be declared directly inside a credential via the `models:` field — they are automatically extracted and added to the global models list with the credential name pre-filled.

See [Load Balancing](../advanced/balancing.md) for details on multi-credential routing.

## YAML Anchors for Models

When many credentials share the same set of models, YAML anchors eliminate repetition.
Define a template once with `&anchor-name` and reference it with `*anchor-name`.

### List anchor in `x-model-templates`

The `x-model-templates` top-level key is a dedicated namespace for anchor definitions. It is not processed by the router — its sole purpose is to hold anchors so they can be referenced elsewhere.

```yaml
x-model-templates:
  vertex-base-models: &vertex-base-models
    - name: gemini-2.5-flash
      rpm: 100
      tpm: 50000
    - name: gemini-2.5-pro
      rpm: 50
      tpm: 100000

credentials:
  - name: "vertex_v1"
    type: "vertex-ai"
    project_id: "proj-1"
    location: "global"
    credentials_file: "keys/proj-1.json"
    rpm: 100
    models: *vertex-base-models   # expands to the full list

  - name: "vertex_v2"
    type: "vertex-ai"
    project_id: "proj-2"
    location: "global"
    credentials_file: "keys/proj-2.json"
    rpm: 100
    models: *vertex-base-models   # same list, credential set to "vertex_v2"
```

Each model copy automatically gets the parent credential name injected, so no manual `credential:` field is needed inside the template.

### Single-model anchor

An anchor can also target a single model mapping and be used as an item in a `models:` list:

```yaml
x-model-templates:
  flash: &flash
    name: gemini-2.5-flash
    rpm: 100
    tpm: 50000

credentials:
  - name: "vertex_v1"
    type: "vertex-ai"
    project_id: "proj-1"
    location: "global"
    credentials_file: "keys/proj-1.json"
    rpm: 100
    models:
      - *flash               # single model from anchor
      - name: gemini-2.5-pro # inline model
        rpm: 50
        tpm: 100000
```

### Expanding a list anchor inside the top-level `models:` section

A list anchor can be expanded inline within the top-level `models:` sequence. The router flattens the result so all items end up as a flat list:

```yaml
x-model-templates:
  shared-models: &shared-models
    - name: gemini-2.5-flash
      credential: vertex_v1
      rpm: 100
      tpm: 50000
    - name: gemini-2.5-pro
      credential: vertex_v1
      rpm: 50
      tpm: 100000

models:
  - *shared-models        # expands and flattens both items into the list
  - name: gpt-4o
    credential: openai_main
    rpm: 60
    tpm: 80000
```

### Supported combinations

| Syntax                   | Location                        | Result                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `models: *list-anchor`   | inside a credential             | list items added with that credential name    |
| `- *list-anchor`         | inside a credential's `models:` | list items added with that credential name    |
| `- *single-model-anchor` | inside a credential's `models:` | single model added with that credential name  |
| `- *list-anchor`         | top-level `models:`             | list expanded and flattened into the sequence |
