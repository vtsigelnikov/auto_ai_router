# Responses API

Auto AI Router implements the [OpenAI Responses API](../refs/openai_responses_api.md) and routes requests natively to Anthropic, Comet API, Vertex AI, and AWS Bedrock — without converting through Chat Completions format as an intermediary.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path                    | Description                                    |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/v1/responses`         | Create a response (HTTP, optionally streaming) |
| `GET`  | `/v1/responses`         | Create a response via WebSocket                |
| `GET`  | `/v1/responses/{id}`    | Retrieve a stored response by ID               |
| `POST` | `/v1/responses/compact` | Compact a conversation into a summary item     |

## GPT-6 Astra

Configure `gpt-6-astra` on an existing OpenAI-compatible credential. OpenAI credentials
forward Responses requests directly to `/v1/responses`. For example, with an existing
credential named `openai_main`:

```yaml
models:
  - name: gpt-6-astra
    credential: openai_main
```

For GPT-6 requests, the router removes `temperature`, `top_p`, and `top_logprobs`.
Responses requests also drop `message.output_text.logprobs` from `include`, preserving
other include values. Chat Completions requests drop `logprobs` and use the existing
`max_tokens` to `max_completion_tokens` conversion. `max_output_tokens` is preserved.
See the [OpenAI migration guide](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/latest-model).

Use Responses for tool calling. Native HTTP forwarding preserves `async` tool flags,
`additional_tools` with required or named `tool_choice`, `configuration_update` input
items, `prompt_cache_breakpoint`, and `prompt_cache_options`. Reasoning values such as
`max` and `pro` are forwarded for the upstream to interpret; the router does not add
provider-specific reasoning aliases. Cache options do not guarantee a cache hit.

Prices still come from `server.model_prices_link` or the LiteLLM database. Add the
model's applicable rates there before using budget enforcement. Input, output, cache
read/write, and reasoning usage use the existing billing pipeline.

## Request Parameters

All standard Responses API parameters are supported. The table below lists the full set recognized by the router:

| Parameter                | Type             | Description                                             |

!!! note "Provider coverage"
Not all providers support every parameter. See the [Provider Support](#provider-support) table below.

!!! note "Service tier is router-controlled"
`service_tier` is ignored and removed by Auto AI Router. Clients cannot select an upstream
service tier. The effective tier is controlled by the router/provider configuration.

## Content Types

The `input` array accepts items of different types. Supported `ContentPart` types within messages:

| `type`        | Fields                                                       | Description                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `input_text`  | `text`                                                       | Plain text                                   |
| `input_image` | `image_url` (string or `{url, detail}`), `file_id`, `detail` | Image from URL or provider-supported file ID |
| `input_audio` | `data` (base64), `format`                                    | Audio clip                                   |
| `input_file`  | `file_data`, `file_url`, `file_id`, `filename`               | File/document input                          |

### Anthropic-backed `input_file`

For Anthropic, Comet API, and ProMan routes that use the Anthropic-compatible native Responses converter:

| Form                                                                       | Status      | Provider mapping                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{"type":"input_file","file_data":"data:application/pdf;base64,<BASE64>"}` | Supported   | Anthropic `document/source:base64` with `media_type: application/pdf` |
| `{"type":"input_file","file_url":"https://example.com/document.pdf"}`      | Supported   | Anthropic `document/source:url`                                       |
| `{"type":"input_file","file_id":"file-abc"}`                               | Unsupported | Returns `400 Bad Request`                                             |

AIR does not implement a Files API resolver or OpenAI/LiteLLM file ID to Anthropic file ID mapping. `file_id` values are provider/credential scoped and are not forwarded to Anthropic-backed routes.

Malformed PDF data URIs, non-base64 encodings, empty document sources, and unsupported document source types are rejected as client request validation errors (`400 Bad Request`) rather than internal conversion failures.

Input items can also be function call / function call output items for multi-turn tool use:

```json
{"type": "function_call", "call_id": "call_abc", "name": "get_weather", "arguments": "{\"city\":\"Paris\"}"}
{"type": "function_call_output", "call_id": "call_abc", "output": "{\"temp\":22}"}
```

## Multi-Turn Conversations

### Storing Responses

Set `"store": true` to persist a response. A stored response can be retrieved later:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/responses/resp_01abc... \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-your-key"
```

### Continuing a Conversation

Pass `previous_response_id` to continue from a prior response. The router reconstructs the previous output as input context before sending to the provider:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8080/v1", api_key="sk-your-key")

first = client.responses.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    input="What is the capital of France?",
    store=True,
)

second = client.responses.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    input="And what language do they speak there?",
    previous_response_id=first.id,
    store=True,
)
```

## Streaming

Add `"stream": true` to receive Server-Sent Events. The event sequence follows the Responses API specification:

```
response.created
response.in_progress
  response.output_item.added
  response.content_part.added
  response.output_text.delta  (repeated)
  response.output_text.done
  response.content_part.done
  response.output_item.done
response.completed
[DONE]
```

```python
stream = client.responses.create(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    input="Tell me about Paris",
    stream=True,
)

for event in stream:
    if event.type == "response.output_text.delta":
        print(event.delta, end="", flush=True)
```

### Reasoning

Reasoning streams as a `reasoning` output item with one `summary_text` part, the same way for
every provider (Chat Completions upstreams, Anthropic, Vertex AI):

```
response.output_item.added            (item.type = "reasoning")
response.reasoning_summary_part.added
response.reasoning_summary_text.delta (repeated)
response.reasoning_summary_text.done
response.reasoning_summary_part.done
response.output_item.done
```

Chat upstreams return reasoning as `reasoning_content` or `reasoning`; the router reads both.
It is raw chain of thought, but it is still exposed as `summary_text`, because Responses
clients such as Codex render the summary.

When reasoning items are sent back as input:

| Upstream         | Mapping                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Chat Completions | `reasoning_content` of the assistant message it belongs to, only for turns after the last `user` message (the current tool loop) |
| Anthropic        | `thinking` block carrying the text and its signature (`encrypted_content`)                                                       |
| Vertex AI        | Dropped. Gemini keeps continuity through `thoughtSignature`                                                                      |

Chat providers do not get reasoning from older turns. DeepSeek thinking mode and Kimi need it
only inside the current tool loop, `deepseek-reasoner` rejects it on past turns, and it costs
input tokens. A reasoning-only turn with no message or tool call, for example one cut off by
`max_output_tokens`, is dropped.

## WebSocket Protocol

The router accepts WebSocket connections on `GET /v1/responses` (with `Upgrade: websocket` header). By default, each turn uses the existing HTTP/SSE provider path. Enable native upstream WebSockets for models whose providers support them:

```yaml
models:
  - name: gpt-6-astra
    credential: openai_main
    websocket_responses: true
```

### Native Upstream Mode

Native mode connects directly to the configured provider's WebSocket Responses endpoint.
It supports OpenAI and existing `proxy`/`air` credentials with native Responses passthrough.
All credentials serving an opted-in model must support WebSockets. For a custom deployment
name, also set `passthrough_responses: true` if native Responses is not auto-detected.

Send `response.create` to begin. Once `response.created` arrives, GPT-6 Astra accepts
`response.steer` during generation:

```json
{"type":"response.steer","previous_response_id":"resp_1","input":"Keep the answer shorter."}
```

Steering accepts user input, and the upstream creates its successor response automatically.
The router tracks and bills each response separately. If `response.steer.pending` requests
a tool result, send another `response.create` with the original `previous_response_id`
and the required `function_call_output`. Async tool flags, cache options, and
`configuration_update` items in `response.create.input` follow the HTTP passthrough rules.
Support for these features still depends on the provider; Azure WebSocket transport does
not imply Azure supports steering. See [OpenAI steering](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/steering).

Native sessions use one model and credential, one active response, and at most one queued
steer. Authentication, model access, credential scope, rate limits, and budget checks run
for each create/steer request. Provider usage, including cache usage, feeds the existing
billing pipeline; continuation reservations include an estimate of prior context.

`stream` and `background` are removed and `store` is forced to `false`. Responses remain
on the upstream connection: router HTTP retrieval and cross-connection continuation are
unavailable. Reconnect with full input history after an upstream disconnect, credential
change, one hour, or 128 admitted responses. There is no automatic provider fallback
inside an established session. By default, disconnecting closes the upstream and uses estimated usage for unfinished
responses. With `drain_upstream_on_abort: true`, the router keeps reading for the existing
drain grace period to collect final provider usage.

The remaining examples also apply to the default HTTP/SSE bridge; its local and persistent
response-store behavior is described separately below.

### Connection

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8080/v1/responses", {
  headers: { "Authorization": "Bearer sk-your-key" }
});
```

### Sending a Request

Send a JSON message with `"type": "response.create"` and any standard Responses API fields:

```json
{
  "type": "response.create",
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
  "input": "Hello! What is 2+2?",
  "stream": true
}
```

In the default bridge, `type` is stripped before forwarding HTTP. Native mode sends `response.create` over the upstream WebSocket.

### Receiving Events

The server sends each SSE event as a plain JSON text message (no `data:` prefix, no `[DONE]`). Turn completion is signaled by a terminal event (`response.completed`, `response.failed`, `response.incomplete`, `error`).

```javascript
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  if (data.type === "response.output_text.delta") {
    process.stdout.write(data.delta);
  } else if (data.type === "response.completed") {
    console.log("\nDone");
  } else if (data.type === "error") {
    console.error(data.error.message);
  }
};
```

### Error Events

HTTP errors are converted to structured WebSocket error events:

```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "sequence_number": 0,
  "error": {
    "code": "api_error",
    "message": "Rate limit exceeded",
    "type": "server_error",
    "param": null
  }
}
```

### Connection-Local Cache (HTTP/SSE Bridge)

When `store: false` is explicitly set, completed responses are cached in connection-local memory for the duration of the WebSocket connection. This allows `previous_response_id` continuations within the same session without a persistent store. The cache is cleared on reconnect.

When `store` is absent or `true`, the persistent response store handles continuations across reconnects.

### Multi-Turn Example

```javascript
// First turn
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  type: "response.create",
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
  input: "What is the capital of France?",
  store: false,
}));

// Wait for response.completed, capture response ID, then:
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  type: "response.create",
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
  input: "What language do they speak there?",
  previous_response_id: "<id from first turn>",
  store: false,
}));
```

## Compact API

`POST /v1/responses/compact` summarizes a conversation into a single compaction item. This is useful for reducing context size while preserving essential information.

### Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/responses/compact \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-your-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    "input": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "What is photosynthesis?"},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants..."}
    ]
  }'
```

**Requirements:**

- `model` is required
- Request body limit: 10 MB

### Response

```json
{
  "id": "resp_01abc...",
  "object": "response.compaction",
  "created_at": 1234567890,
  "output": [
    {
      "type": "compaction",
      "id": "compact_01xyz...",
      "encrypted_content": "<summary of the conversation>"
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 120,
    "output_tokens": 45,
    "total_tokens": 165
  }
}
```

The `encrypted_content` field contains the model's summary. Use this item in `input` for subsequent requests to continue the conversation from the compacted context.

## Native vs Passthrough Mode

The router uses two modes for Responses API requests:

| Mode            | Description                                                                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Native**      | Responses API request → provider-specific format directly. Preserves all provider features |
| **Passthrough** | Responses API request → Chat Completions → provider, then Chat Completions → Responses API |

Native mode is used automatically for **Anthropic**, **Comet API**, **Vertex AI**, and **AWS Bedrock**. Passthrough is used for OpenAI and other providers that already speak Responses API natively.

The mode can be overridden via model configuration:

```yaml
models:
  - name: "my-model"
    passthrough_responses: true  # force passthrough
```

## Provider Support

| Feature                  | Anthropic | Comet API | Vertex AI | Bedrock | OpenAI |

| `compact` endpoint       | ✅        | ✅        | ✅        | ✅      | ✅     |

## Retry and Fallback

When a provider credential returns a rate-limit error (429), the router automatically tries the next available credential of the same type. The original HTTP error code is preserved in the final response — the client receives 429 (not 502) when all credentials of the appropriate type are exhausted.

When no credentials are available at all, the router returns 503 Service Unavailable.
